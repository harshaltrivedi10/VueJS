Used Axios to send HTTP requests

Made a new file: axios.js to store defaults and request/response intercptors

Interceptors are used to intercept request / response before actually using the request or response object. They are defined in axios.js

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
